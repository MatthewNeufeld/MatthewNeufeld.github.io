        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I didn’t always know that I would be interested
          in a technical field, however; upon teaching myself how to program in Python
           shortly after graduating high school, I made it my goal to pursue a
           career in software development.
           I quickly developed an appetite for learning any kind of technology I could
           get my hands on.
           On top of my studies this fall semester, I enrolled in a Full Stack
           Web Development Bootcamp, which I thoroughly enjoyed as I was able
           to apply the programming fundamentals I am learning in university to create
           tangible web applications that anyone can use. </p>
        <br />
        <p>My passions are not restricted to technology, however. In February 2021,
          I read Robert Kiyosaki’s “Rich Dad Poor Dad.” In his book, Kiyosaki states
          that the ability to sell is one of the most valuable skills a person can have.
          I took this advice to heart, and for the past two summers, I have worked
          as a commission-based door-to-door sales representative for Canadian Property Stars.
          Since joining the company, I have achieved distinction as one of the
          highest revenue-generating salespeople across six locations. Working
          in sales has taught me how lead-indicators such as attitude,
          work ethic, and teachability can increase job performance.</p>

        <h5>Newsletter Signup Form</h5>
        <div class="pra">
          <p>Developed a newsletter signup form for a fictious company as a full stack
          web application. The front-end was developed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap and the back-end was
          developed with Node.js and Express.js.
           The user data is sent to MailChimp using the MailChimp API, and
           stored in their database. This application was deployed live to the internet
         using Heroku.</p>

        <div class="pra">
          <p>Created a custom API with get, post, delete, put and path methods
          designed to aid in storing and organizing player data. This project was developed
        using Express.js and Node.js while Body Parser was utilized in obtaining player data.
       Used Postman and Studio 3T to test functionality of the API. The player schema is created with Mongoose and is composed of the player's name
     and team, as well as 8 key statistics.</p>
